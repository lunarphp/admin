# Lunar Admin Panel

See the docs at https://lunar-panel.vercel.app/

## TODO

- [ ] How to set the Lunar logo?
- [ ] How will addons add buttons etc to existing screens?
- [ ] Field types
- [ ] Model Policies
- [ ] Some JSON fields (e.g. ProductOption) are cast to Collections, not an ArrayObject
- [ ] Add Spatie ActivityLog to more (all?) models
- [ ] Tax Zone types are "country", "states", "postcodes" -> would prefer it to be "countries" so it's consistent
- [ ] `ListField` FieldType shouldn't really have "Field" in its name -> change to simply "List"
- [ ] Sometimes we use "Enabled" other times "Active". Do we want to consider consistency here also?
- [ ] Staff "firstname" "lastname" I think should have underscores, e.g. "first_name"
- [x] How to allow devs to extend Lunar's forms and tables
- [x] How to allow devs to overide validation rules
- [x] Allow devs to extend by adding their own pages/resources
- [ ] Tests!!
- [ ] Mention influence from https://filamentphp.com/plugins/spatie-activity-log
